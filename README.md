# halo-oauth-prelim

Attempts to codify the process of acquiring a Halo Infinite Spartan Token to provide API access to Halo Infinite game stats.

This was "for fun and learning opportunities" before utilizing the SPNKR.py library to acquire stats & data.

Halfway functional, enough for me to become quasi comfortable with this oauth process, it serves as an archive of my efforts.
